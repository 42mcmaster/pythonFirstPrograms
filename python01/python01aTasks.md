# Tasks 1a: Computer Science Fundamentals

## Task 1: Algorithm Writing (15 minutes)

Write an algorithm for ONE of the following everyday tasks. Be specific and include every step:

a) Making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
b) Logging into your school email
c) Finding a book in the library

**Requirements:**
- Number each step
- Make sure each instruction is clear and specific
- Include decision points (if needed)
- Make sure it terminates

**Example format:**
```
Algorithm: Tying Shoelaces
1. Take one lace in each hand
2. Cross the right lace over the left lace
3. ...
```

## Task 2: Algorithm Analysis (10 minutes)

Look at this algorithm for finding the larger of two numbers:

```
1. Look at the first number
2. Look at the second number
3. The first number is larger
```

**Questions:**
a) What's wrong with this algorithm?
b) How would you fix it?
c) Write a corrected version that works for ANY two numbers

## Task 3: Hardware Matching (10 minutes)

Match each computer task with the hardware component primarily responsible:

| Task | Component (CPU, RAM, Hard Drive, Input Device, Output Device) |
|------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Storing your essay permanently | |
| Clicking to open a file | |
| Displaying your essay on screen | |
| Processing calculations | |
| Temporarily holding the essay while editing | |

## Task 4: Input-Process-Output (10 minutes)

For each scenario, identify the INPUT, PROCESSING, and OUTPUT:

**a) Calculator app adding 5 + 3**
- Input: 
- Processing: 
- Output: 

**b) Spotify playing a song**
- Input: 
- Processing: 
- Output: 

**c) Weather app showing today's temperature**
- Input: 
- Processing: 
- Output: 

## Extension Challenge (Optional)
