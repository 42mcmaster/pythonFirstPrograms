# Lesson 1b: Introduction to Python & IDLE

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what Python is and why we use it
- Open and navigate the IDLE environment
- Understand the role of an interpreter
- Execute simple Python expressions in the shell

## What is Python?

**Python** is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in the early 1990s.

### Why Python?
- **Easy to read**: Looks almost like English
- **Interpreted**: Gets immediate results
- **Versatile**: Used for websites, data analysis, AI, games, and more
- **Popular**: One of the most in-demand programming languages

### High-Level vs. Low-Level Languages

- **High-level** (Python, Java): Easier for humans to read and write
- **Low-level** (Assembly, Machine Code): Closer to what the computer actually understands

Python is an **interpreted language** - it translates your code line-by-line as it runs.

## The IDLE Environment

**IDLE** = Integrated Development and Learning Environment

### Opening IDLE
1. **Windows**: Start Menu → Python → IDLE
2. **Mac**: Applications → Python folder → IDLE
3. **Linux**: Terminal → type `idle3`

### The Python Shell Window

When IDLE opens, you see:
```
Python 3.x.x ...
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license()" for more information.
>>> 
```

The `>>>` is the **prompt** - it's waiting for you to type something!

### Your First Python Code

Type this after the prompt and press Enter:
```python
>>> print("Hello, World!")
```

You should see:
```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You just wrote your first Python program!

## Python as a Calculator

Try these expressions (type each one and press Enter):

```python
>>> 5 + 3
8

>>> 10 - 4
6

>>> 6 * 7
42

>>> 15 / 3
5.0

>>> 2 ** 3
8
```

**Operators:**
- `+` addition
- `-` subtraction
- `*` multiplication
- `/` division
- `**` exponentiation (power)
- `//` integer division
- `%` modulus (remainder)

## Quitting IDLE

- Click the window's close button, OR
- Press `Ctrl+D` (Windows/Linux) or `Control+D` (Mac)

## Important Notes

- Python is **case-sensitive**: `Print` and `print` are different!
- If you make a mistake, just press Enter and try again
- Use the **up arrow** to recall previous commands
- You can't break anything - experiment freely!
