# Lesson 1a: Computer Science Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives
- Define what an algorithm is
- Identify the features of a good algorithm
- Understand information processing
- Describe basic computer hardware components

## Key Concepts

### Algorithms
An **algorithm** is a sequence of steps that describes a computational process. Think of it like a recipe - it tells you exactly what to do, step by step.

#### Example: Subtracting Two Numbers
1. Write down the numbers with the larger number above the smaller one, digits aligned from the right
2. Start with the rightmost column and work left
3. Write down the difference between digits in the current column (borrowing if necessary)
4. If there's no next column, stop; otherwise move to the column to the left and go to step 3

#### Features of an Algorithm
- **Finite**: Has a specific number of instructions
- **Well-defined**: Each instruction can be performed effectively
- **Terminates**: Eventually halts with a solution
- **General**: Solves a class of problems, not just one specific instance

### Information Processing
When computers execute algorithms, they:
- Start with **input** (data going in)
- **Transform** information according to well-defined rules
- Produce **output** (results)

Information can be represented as: text, numbers, images, music, video, and even the algorithms themselves!

### Computer Hardware

A modern computer system has these basic components:

1. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The "brain" that processes data
2. **Memory (RAM)**: Temporary storage for data and programs while running
3. **Input Devices**: Keyboard, mouse, etc.
4. **Output Devices**: Monitor, printer, etc.
5. **Secondary Storage**: Hard drive, SSD for permanent storage

#### Memory
- Information is stored as patterns of **binary digits** (1s and 0s)
- **RAM** is internal/primary memory (fast but temporary)
- **Hard drives** are external/secondary memory (slower but permanent)

## Discussion Questions
1. What algorithms do you use in everyday life?
2. Why is it important that algorithms eventually halt?
3. What's the difference between RAM and a hard drive?
