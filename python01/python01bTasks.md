# Tasks 1b: Python & IDLE Basics

## Task 1: IDLE Scavenger Hunt (10 minutes)

Open IDLE and answer these questions by exploring:

1. What version of Python is installed on your computer?
2. In the top menu, what options do you see? (List at least 4)
3. Click "Help" â†’ "Python Docs" - what website does it open?
4. Right-click in the shell window - what menu options appear?

## Task 2: Calculator Practice (15 minutes)

Use IDLE's shell as a calculator. Type each expression and record the result:

```python
# Basic Operations
a) 23 + 17 = 
b) 100 - 67 = 
c) 12 * 8 = 
d) 144 / 12 = 

# Slightly Harder
e) 5 ** 2 = 
f) 2 ** 10 = 
g) 100 / 3 = 
h) 100 // 3 = 
i) 100 % 3 = 

# Word Problems (write the expression AND the answer)
j) You have 5 friends and 23 cookies. How many cookies per person? 
   Expression: 
   Answer: 

k) A square room is 12 feet on each side. What's the area?
   Expression: 
   Answer: 

l) What's 15 squared?
   Expression: 
   Answer: 
```

**Question:** What's the difference between `/` and `//`? Between `//` and `%`?

## Task 3: Print Statement Practice (10 minutes)

Type these `print` statements in IDLE. Record what appears:

```python
>>> print("Python is fun!")

>>> print("I am learning to code")

>>> print(100)

>>> print(5 + 3)

>>> print("5 + 3")
```

**Questions:**
1. What's the difference between `print(5 + 3)` and `print("5 + 3")`?
2. What do the quotation marks do?

## Task 4: Experimentation (10 minutes)

Try these experiments and record what happens:

```python
# Experiment 1
>>> print(Hello)

# Experiment 2  
>>> print("Hello)

# Experiment 3
>>> print('Hello World!')

# Experiment 4
>>> print("Hello" + "World")

# Experiment 5
>>> print("Python" * 3)
```

**For each experiment:**
- Did it work? (Yes/No)
- If no, what was the error message?
- If yes, what was the output?
- What did you learn?

## Task 5: Create Your Own (5 minutes)

Use `print()` to display:
1. Your name
2. Your favorite number
3. A calculation of how many days are in 4 weeks
4. A silly message using string multiplication (like "Python" * 3)

## Extension Challenge (Optional)

The `**` operator does exponentiation. Can you figure out:
- What's 2 to the power of 16?
- How would you calculate the volume of a cube with sides of length 5?
- Can you use `**` with decimal numbers? Try `2.5 ** 2`
