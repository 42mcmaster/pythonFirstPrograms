# Chapter 3 Team Project: Paired Programs

## Overview
Work with **one partner** to create **two related Python programs** that demonstrate your mastery of conditional statements and loops. Both programs should work together as a connected system.

## Project Timeline
- **Day 1**: Choose theme, plan features, create pseudocode
- **Day 2-3**: Code Program 1 (easier program)
- **Day 4-5**: Code Program 2 (more complex program)
- **Day 6**: Testing, documentation, presentation prep
- **Day 7**: Present to class

## Team Requirements
- [ ] Teams of exactly 2 students
- [ ] Both partners contribute to both programs
- [ ] Document who worked on what in comments
- [ ] Create a shared GitHub repo for the project
- [ ] Each program should be in a separate `.py` file

## Technical Requirements (MUST USE)

### Required in BOTH Programs:
- [ ] At least one `for` loop with `range()`
- [ ] At least one `if-elif-else` structure
- [ ] User input with `input()`
- [ ] Formatted output (tables, aligned text, or reports)
- [ ] At least one accumulator pattern
- [ ] Comments explaining complex sections

### Required in AT LEAST ONE Program:
- [ ] Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- [ ] A loop that counts up or down by a step value
- [ ] String traversal (looping through characters)
- [ ] Nested conditionals (if inside if)
- [ ] Lists to store data

## Program Complexity

**Program 1 (Foundation Program)**: 
- 40-60 lines of code
- Focuses on data collection and basic processing
- Input-focused with simple validation

**Program 2 (Advanced Program)**:
- 60-100 lines of code  
- Processes data from Program 1 or generates complex output
- Must include formatted tables or detailed reports

## Theme Options

Choose ONE theme for your team. Both programs must fit your chosen theme.
