# Chapter 3 Team Project: Paired Programs

## Overview
Work with **one partner** to create **two related Python programs** that demonstrate your mastery of conditional statements and loops. Both programs should work together as a connected system.

## Project Timeline
- **Day 1**: Choose theme, plan features, create pseudocode
- **Day 2-3**: Code Program 1 (easier program)
- **Day 4-5**: Code Program 2 (more complex program)
- **Day 6**: Testing, documentation, presentation prep
- **Day 7**: Present to class

## Team Requirements
- [ ] Teams of exactly 2 students
- [ ] Both partners contribute to both programs
- [ ] Document who worked on what in comments
- [ ] Create a shared GitHub repo for the project
- [ ] Each program should be in a separate `.py` file

## Technical Requirements (MUST USE)

### Required in BOTH Programs:
- [ ] At least one loop (`for` with `range()` OR `while`)
- [ ] At least one `if-elif-else` structure
- [ ] User input with `input()`
- [ ] Clear, organized output
- [ ] At least one accumulator pattern
- [ ] Comments explaining complex sections

### Required in AT LEAST ONE Program:
- [ ] A `while` loop (for input validation, menu systems, or repeated actions)
- [ ] A `for` loop with `range()` (for counting or iterating a specific number of times)
- [ ] Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- [ ] String traversal (looping through characters)
- [ ] Nested conditionals (if inside if)
- [ ] Lists to store data

## Program Complexity

**Program 1 (Foundation Program)**: 
- 40-60 lines of code
- Focuses on data collection and basic processing
- Input-focused with simple validation

**Program 2 (Advanced Program)**:
- 60-100 lines of code  
- Processes data from Program 1 or generates complex output
- Must include summary statistics or detailed reports

   - `program1.py` (descriptive name)
   - `program2.py` (descriptive name)
   - `README.md` with:
     - Team member names
     - Theme chosen
     - Description of each program
     - How to run the programs
     - Features implemented
     - Who did what

2. **Brief Presentation** (5 minutes):
   - Demonstrate both programs
   - Explain one interesting technical challenge
   - Show how your programs work together
   - Answer questions

## Planning Template

Use this checklist in your first planning session:

```
Required Python Concepts Checklist:
[ ] For loops with range()
[ ] While loops
[ ] If-elif-else statements
[ ] Logical operators
[ ] Accumulator pattern
[ ] Input validation
[ ] String traversal
[ ] Lists
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Get a basic version working first, then add features
2. **Test Often**: Run your program after every few lines
3. **Use While Loops Wisely**: Great for menus, input validation, and "keep going?" prompts
4. **Use For Loops for Counting**: When you know how many times to loop, use `for` with `range()`
5. **Communicate**: Check in with your partner regularly
6. **Comment As You Go**: Don't wait until the end
7. **Handle Bad Input**: Use `while` loops to re-prompt for valid input
8. **Ask for Help**: Use your teacher and classmates as resources

## While Loop Examples

**Input Validation:**
```python
grade = -1
while grade < 0 or grade > 100:
    grade = int(input("Enter grade (0-100): "))
```

**Menu System:**
```python
choice = ""
while choice != "quit":
    print("1. Add item")
    print("2. View items")
    choice = input("Enter choice: ")
```

**Keep Going Pattern:**
```python
continue_program = "yes"
while continue_program == "yes":
    # do something
    continue_program = input("Continue? (yes/no): ")
```

Good luck! Remember: this project tests everything you've learned about loops, conditionals, and input validation. Make it interesting, make it work, and most importantly‚Äîwork together!
